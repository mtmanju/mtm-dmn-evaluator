## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly

Send an email to: [INSERT_SECURITY_EMAIL]

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

### 4. What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate the vulnerability
- We will provide regular updates on our progress
- We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update Java and Maven dependencies
   - Monitor for security advisories

2. **File Upload Security**
   - Only upload trusted DMN files
   - Validate file contents before processing
   - Limit file size to prevent DoS attacks

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Consider network segmentation

4. **Access Control**
   - Implement authentication if needed
   - Use proper authorization mechanisms
   - Monitor access logs

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize file uploads
   - Use parameterized queries

2. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security events appropriately
   - Implement proper exception handling

3. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like OWASP Dependency Check
   - Keep dependencies up to date

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **File Upload Validation**: DMN file type and size validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper handling of user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Input validation improvements
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] Audit logging

## Vulnerability Disclosure

When we discover or receive reports of security vulnerabilities, we will:

1. **Assess the severity** using CVSS scoring
2. **Develop a fix** as quickly as possible
3. **Test the fix** thoroughly
4. **Release a security update** with appropriate versioning
5. **Publish a security advisory** with details and mitigation steps

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published in:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Project documentation
